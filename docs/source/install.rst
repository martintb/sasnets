Installation
************

"Installing" SASNets is easy: simply clone the Github repository https://github.com/scattering/SASNets. Do a ::

  pip install -r requirements.txt

and optionally ::

  pip install -r optional-requirements.txt

It is highly recommended that you use the PostgreSQL version of SASNets, as this uses significantly less memory and is much faster. This requires you to have PostgreSQL installed. Consult your OS package manager documentation for how to do so.

SASNets is ready to use out of the box; no actual installation is necessary. See the individual function documentation for more information.

If you have any problems, file an issue on Github or contact the developers directly.
