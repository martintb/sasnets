# SASNets

SASNets is a Python program for determining the shape that a SANS (Small Angle Neutron Scattering) dataset of Q and I(Q) comes from. It currently contains two nets: a traditional MLP of 9 layers, and a 1D convolutional network of 11 layers. 

SASNets makes use of datafiles generated by a fork of SASModels, found at [kisaayano/sasmodels](https://github.com/kisaayano/sasmodels).
