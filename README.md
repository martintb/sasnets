# SASNets

SASNets is a Python program for determining the shape that a SANS (Small Angle Neutron Scattering) dataset of Q and I(Q) comes from. It currently contains two nets: a traditional MLP of 9 layers, and a 1D convolutional network of 11 layers.

SASNets makes use of datafiles generated by a fork of SASModels, found at [pkienzle/sasmodels](https://github.com/pkienzle/sasmodels).

Basic flow:

    # Grab sasnets repo, and sasmodels repo to generate data.
    git clone https://github.com/scattering/sasnets
    git clone https://github.com/pkienzle/sasmodels

    # Create the conda environment.
    # ... probably missing some packages here...
    conda create -n sasnets python numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas seaborn
    conda activate sasnets
    pip install columnize # ... for pretty output columns [optional]

    # Add tensorflow or tensorflow-gpu, depending on whether you have nvidia
    # hardware (and drivers for cuda 10.0 for tensorflow 2.x).
    #conda install -y tensorflow-gpu
    conda install -y tensorflow

    # Need sasmodels for data generation. This requires pycuda, pyopencl
    # or a C compiler to run.
    conda install -y pybind11 appdirs decorator mako
    pip install pyopencl
    #pip install pycuda
    #pip install tinycc  # small C compiler for windows, if you need it.

    # Work from the sasnets directory
    cd sasnets

    # Generate the table "train" in sasnets.db.  In this case we are
    # only selecting the different types of sphere models.
    bin/sasgen --count=2000 --mono=true *sphere | tee generate.log
    # Use 'all' for the full dataset (600 MB at 2000 items per model).

    # Train on the dataset (you will want to use more epochs...)
    bin/sasnet -v --epochs=10

    # Show training results
    bin/sasanal
    # Show dendrogram
    bin/sasanal -c

On windows, use `python bin/sasgen`, etc.
